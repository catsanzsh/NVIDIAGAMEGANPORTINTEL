  "model": "EMUGAN",
  "version": "1.0A",
  "description": "EMUGAN is a web-based generative adversarial simulator that learns to replicate dynamic game environments by observing agent interactions.",
  "features": "Runs entirely inside Google Gemini Functions, supports real-time URL or emulator input, and generates next frames using memory-enhanced GAN architecture.",
  "training_data": "Compatible with VizDoom and custom .npy datasets of image-action sequences, enabling flexible environment adaptation.",
  "usage": "Interprets game logic via Gemini’s cloud interpreter, allowing browser-based inference and interactive sandboxing with minimal setup.",
  "inspiration": "Built on NVIDIA’s GameGAN (CVPR 2020), upgraded for decentralized game synthesis and modular emulation workflows."
